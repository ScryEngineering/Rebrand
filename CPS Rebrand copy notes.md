### Natural language processing

#### Definition

The use of computer algorithms to parse natural languages. 

Alternate: The application of computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of natural language and speech. AKA: The use of different techniques from computer science (algorithms) to understand and manipulate human language and speech.

Alternate: The science of extracting meaning and learning from text data

- a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence focused on enabling computers to understand and process human languages, to get computers to a human-level understanding of language. Computers can't yet "read between the lines" to understand what the language is really trying to say. They don't have intuitive understanding of natural language. 
- Now, deep learning and recent advances in machine learning has enabled us to write programs to perform things like language translation, semantic understanding and text summarization. All these add value, making it easy to understand and perform computations on large text blocks without manual effort

- NLP plays a critical role in supporting machine-human interactions (Source: https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32)



#### Practical uses/applications

- Identifying different cohorts of users/customers (e.g. predicting churn, lifetime value, product preferences)

- Accurately  detecting and extracting different categories of feedback (positive and  negative reviews/opinions, mentions of particular attributes such as  clothing size/fit…)

- Classifying text according to intent (e.g. request for basic help, urgent problem)

- Other applications include translation, chat bots and specific intricate analyses of text documents. Much of this is done using deep learning, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTMs) networks - Source: https://towardsdatascience.com/an-easy-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-b1e2801291c1

- Language translations apps such as Google Translate; Word processors such as Microsoft Word and Grammarly that employ NLP to check grammatical accuracy of texts; interactive voice response apps used in call centers to respond to user requests; personal assistant apps such as OK Google, Siri, Cortana and Alexa (Source: https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32)

#### Challenges

https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-major-open-problems-in-natural-language-understanding

- Ambiguity 
  Words are unique but can have different meanings depending on the context in which they are being evaluated, resulting in ambiguity. 
  	Lexical ambiguity 
  	Syntactic ambiguity
  	Semantic ambiguity
- Synonymy 
  We can express the same idea with different terms - e.g. the word "fine".
- Syntax 
  The structure of natural language takes into account several rules but also some irregularities in different cases. Sentences can be ordered in different ways but not every ordering of items is valid.
- Coherence
  We make coherence assumptions, which affect our interpretation
  e.g.: John likes Bill. He gave him an expensive Christmas present (Explanation or justification?)
- Coreference resolution
  The process of linking together mentions that relates to real-world entities.

#### CPS

A tool to help alleviate document processing bottleneck. In situations where people are doing tedious work on documents, natural language processing can help automate parts of the process so employees can work more efficiently (?)

We can do various work that requires interacting with natural language sources.

- Sentiment analysis
- Chatbots
- Document categorization
- Triage systems

We understand the underlying basic algorithms that are used in this  area which gives us an advantage in selecting algorithms and choosing  the right approaches to solving problems.

Solution: automation of tedious work

### Machine learning and artificial intelligence 

#### Definitions

##### Machine learning

- The process of creating functionality trained from data - CPS.

- A sub-field of Artificial Intelligence
- Goal: Generally, to understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and used by people. 
- Machine learning algorithms allow for computers to train on data inputs and use statistical analysis to output values that fall within a specific range
- ML facilitates computers in building models from sample data to automate decision making processes based on data inputs 

Humans can train machines can learn from past data and to do what humans can do, much faster. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzFI9rgwfU

More data > Better model > Higher Accuracy

Artificial intelligence 

Machines learn by machine learning methods:

- **Supervised learning**
  - Trains algorithms based on example input and output data labeled by humans
  - Algorithm learns by comparing actual output with taught output to find errors and modify the model
  - Uses patterns to predict values on additional unlabeled data
  - ie coins with different weights. the machine would learn which weight (feature) is associated with which currency (label)
    SL uses labeled data to train the model.
- **Unsupervised learning**
  - Provides the algorithm with no labeled data to allow it to find structure within its input data
  - Algorithm finds commonalities among input data
  - Goal: Could be as straightforward as discovering hidden patterns within a dataset. Could also have a goal of feature learning - allows machine to automatically discover representations needed to classify raw data
  - Without being told "correct answer" methods can look at complex, expansive, seemingly unrelated data and organize it in potentially meaningful ways
  - ie Data set with Cricket players and scores. Machine identifies player performance, plots data with wickets on x axis, runs on y axis. 
  - UL uses unlabeled data to train the model.
  - Reinforcement learning
    Rewards-based; Works on a feedback basis. Machine learns from feedback
  - 

Output is final result 

Today, much data is avialable online and being generated every minute. Memory handling capabilities of computers vastly increased; they process data without delay

#### Practical uses and applications

Machine learning algorithms are used in applications where it would be infeasible, either economically or more fundamentally, to build an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task ahead of time.

- Spam filtering (it's not possible to create a set of all the rules to filter spam ahead of time because new spam is created every day. Instead an adaptive system trained on data being received all the time is best, this is a good use case for machine learning.)

- Healthcare, diagnostic predictions
- Semantic analysis tech giants do on social media (facial recognition technology helps users tag and share photos of friends)
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tech converts images of text into movable type 
- Recommendation engines suggest which movies or tv shows to watch next based on user preferences
- Self-driving cars rely on ML to navigate may soon be available 

- Classifications like music suggestions 
- K-nearest neighbours algorithms 
- Supervised: Uses historical data to predict statistically likely future events ie historical stock market info to anticipate upcoming fluctuations; or to filter out spam emails. Tagged photos of dogs used as input data to classify untagged photos of dogs 
- Unsupervised: Transactional data, ie customers and purchases, picking similar attributes from customer profiles and types of purchases. Algorithm can determine women of a certain age range who buy unscented soaps are likely to be pregnant. Marketing campaign re pregnancy and baby products targeted to this audiences to increase purchases. Often used for anomaly detection inc. fraudulent credit card purchases, recommender systems for which products to buy next. 
- UL: Untagged photos of dogs used as input data for algorithm to find likenesses and classify dog photos together.

##### Relevant testimonials/projects

The [Persephone project](https://persephone-asr.org/) is a machine learning project.



##### Information for sales process 

Very high amount of buzz in this area right now.

"rebranding" a statistical approach as a ML approach can have a *large prestige impact* on people unfamiliar with the general field. (ML and statistics have huge overlap but many outsiders to the field don't realize this)

Many people think machine learning and AI are the same, they aren't  but it's also not worth really correcting anyone who's outside the  industry as the distinction is quite subtle.

### Process automation and optimization 

#### Definition



#### Practical uses and applications



#### Challenges



#### Resources



#### CPS 

Automation of tedious tasks can unlock a huge amount of value. Process automation makes up the majority of software while simultaneously remaining low profile.

```
90% of programming jobs are in creating Line of Business software: Economics 101: the price for anything (including you) is a function of the supply of it and demand for it.  Let’s talk about the demand side first.  Most software is not sold in boxes, available on the Internet, or downloaded from the App Store.  Most software is boring one-off applications in corporations, under-girding every imaginable facet of the global economy.  It tracks expenses, it optimizes shipping costs, it assists the accounting department in preparing projections, it helps design new widgets, it prices insurance policies, it flags orders for manual review by the fraud department, etc etc.  Software solves business problems.  Software often solves business problems despite being soul-crushingly boring and of minimal technical complexity.  For example, consider an internal travel expense reporting form.  Across a company with 2,000 employees, that might save 5,000 man-hours a year (at an average fully-loaded cost of $50 an hour) versus handling expenses on paper, for a savings of $250,000 a year.  It does not matter to the company that the reporting form is the world’s simplest CRUD app, it only matters that it either saves the company costs or generates additional revenue.
```

Process automation usually isn't high on software developers'/engineers' assessments of status. As a result, if you talked to many software developers, you would likely get a biased view of just how much line of business software is out there. Many more people will be much more likely to talk about the game they're working on or some "cool" open source library, etc., because these things interest them on a personal level.

To be able to work with the information about processes, you have to get that information into systems so you can use it easily. 

In the data science pyramid, we learn that getting good data into a system enables additional value.

https://github.com/aapeliv/CPS/blob/master/competencies/process-automation.md

Bottom layers of data acquisition and engineering are critical to get the maximum benefits out of advanced analytics. Many businesses get stuck getting data into and out of their systems - a problem greatly

### Mathematical optimization 

#### Definition 

The application of mathematics in the form of algorithms and computer software to improve processes - CPS

Some problems have constraints (equations that place limits on how big or small some variables can get), and some do not - limited vs. unlimited. 

Examples: manufacturing process cannot require more resources than are available, nor can it employ less than zero resources

Objective functions can be maximized or minimized 

Examples: expected return on a stock portfolio; company's production costs/profits; vehicle's time of arrival at a specified destination; a candidate's vote share

Variables can be discrete (for example, only have integer values) or continuous.

Examples: Quantities of stock to be bought or sold; amounts of various resources to be allocated to different production activities; route to be followed by a vehicle through a traffic network; policies to be advocated by a candidate

Some problems are static (do not change over time) while some are dynamic (continual adjustments must be made as changes occur).

Systems can be deterministic (specific causes produce specific effects) or stochastic (involve randomness/probability). 

Equations can be linear (graph to lines) or nonlinear (graph to curves).

##### Terminology 

Different industries may have different words to describe the mathematical optimization space.

These will include:

- Operations research
- Commercial mathematics
- ... ?

Linear programming

- no variables are raised to higher powers, such as squares

Nonlinear programming

- Variables are real numbers, and objective or some constraints are nonlinear functions (can involve squares, square roots, trigonometric functions, products of variables)

https://www.britannica.com/science/optimization

#### Practical uses and applications 

A rich history of mathematical optimization techniques have been used in a wide range of industries, including: 

- Logistics and transport 
- Warehouse planning
- Scheduling and sequencing 
- Bin/box/container packing 

More: 

- Manufacturing 
- Production 
- Inventory control 
- Networks
- Finance 
- Engineering
- Mechanics 
- Economics 
- Control engineering 
- Marketing 
- Policy modeling



##### Consumer level examples 

Various apps that people are likely to have used personally *as consumers* have a substantial mathematical optimization component. For example Uber does this for vehicle routing and trip planning.

Sometimes you can frame things based on common day to day issues if  relevant. For example a big logistics fleet will spend a lot of money on fuel, if  you say "hey the price of fuel has been going up" then you can take that  1% improvement in fuel costs and now say that the savings will only  grow as time goes on.

#### Benefits 

Mathematical optimization works better than traditional "guess and check" methods 

MO is a lot less expensive than building and testing 

In the modern world, pennies matter, microseconds matter, microns matter.

#### CPS

##### How we can provide value 

We can improve processes directly with the power of mathematics and achieve substantial savings in areas suck as:

- Reduced logistics costs 
- Reduction in time required to create/deliver/stock/etc. for a number of processes
- Productivity improvements

Various services people rely on have a substantial mathematical optimization component such as the electricity grid, which has complex supply and demand considerations that directly impact pricing for those commodities. Any small saving here percentage-wise at this scale ends up being an enormous amount of money.

##### Relevant testimonials/projects 

Aapeli and Janis worked at Biarri, a firm offering consulting services in this area. The kibitzer project was entirely based in this area.

Related competencies: Machine learning has substantial overlap with the algorithms and techniques that can be 
used in applied problems in the mathematical optimization space.

##### Information for sales process 

How much turnover/gross value is involved in a process? Learning this can help because you can them frame small percentages of improvements as large amounts of money.

Ex: $1 million cost on some inventory processes over a year in a company, 1% improvement is $10,000 per year, every year. Janis has seen these back-of-the-envelope dollar framing stories be successful.
