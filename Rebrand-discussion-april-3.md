Rebrand 

New name for company 

Iron Mountain document storage and escro services - Janis has had dealing with them. Name gets at what they do but doesn't we do digital backups/paper backups which is good because they do a bunch of different things. 

For us it's complicated - we don't have a well-defined business area right now. 

ie Quantum Black - similar to CPS 

Poster presentation at Pycon coming up - Janis doesn't want to say CPS on poster. Would like to keep logo. Name is too long 

Programming in a lot of orgs has shifted in last 10-20 years. It's seen as something that people don't want to hire from outside. People still want the same thing but they want to call it something else.

Go for vague words 

About page - on-the-ground practical process improvement 



Telstra - equivalent of Bell in Canada. Huge massive telco that bumbles from year to year. Great stuff in some areas and hideous in others. What's become apparent from talking to people there is that there's 2 ways to be more productive. Some people do a lot of work, had really good output, bring value by doing higher volume of work. Others do well because do 1/10 amount of work and get the same results. Being able to not do unncessary work is one of the biggest strengths we have. Doing what we need to do effectively is also a big one. 

Anti-sisphyean consulting idea - orgs that seem to have man pushing the rock up the mountain for eternity thing going on. Does the boulder need to be pushed up the mountain? Answer is often no. Should be doing something completely different. 

ie saying: "A stitch in time saves nine."

Fast fashion vs. sustainability. 

We're looking at positioning on value-based pricing. 

Janis: word in Japanese: regret about physical waste or wasteful action. don't know a word that conveys similar thing in English. Mottainai 

Concern about upcycling - this is a mentality we can engage in when necessary. Many are conditioned to thinking in inefficient way. 

Two sides: reducing unnecessary waste. tricky thing is that it's underrated. Value creation is viewed to be more valuable than waste reduction, even if the waste reduction side is vastly more profitable and better. People run into huge amount of bias. be conscious of this. 

Auto-proiesis 

Defining factors 

we're all extremely intelligent and capable of doing things - the more important thing is able to see a bigger picture, not willing to put up with status quo. going to these workshops has made it clear to me that people work within stupid systems. we can't talk ourselves into thinking that's okay. There's a level of self-delusion that's missing internlly. We are able to learn things and progress quicker than the people I meet. A lot of people don't want to improve. There are people who are  a bit cynical, realize it's wrong but have given up. There are people who accept it, but are complacent. That population that knows it's stupid but are there anyway are more pronounced in software development - you can't delude yourself into thinking everything's perfect and still be effective at those jobs. If you do, it directly impacts your effectiveness in those roles in a negative way. 

Values 

Intelligence 

Education - *this would make for a good blog post*

Important in context of workshops recently; important for us to meet people. 

- imparting knowledge not making ourselves look smart 

  When trying to convey something to somebody, what do they already know? When trying to help someone understand something...how do they have a decision making process. How do they currently turn the knowledge they have into an actionable something? Decision criteria to go from the knowledge they have to a decision 

  Certain groups position themselves to increase the amount of info but not improve decision making process. People who use info as a manipulative thing. Try to improve decision making process but withhold information. Both of these processes aren't improving ability of person to do things themselves, make that self-sufficiency and ability for someone to understand and act on something. 

  Looking at decision making process is much more empowering. Like to make people structurally aware of how they make a decision. 

Design thinking/systems thinking - zooming out to see the whole system. Understanding incentives and motivations of each player in the system. Involves a dash of cynicism and not taking a face value and seeing your little part. Looking at whole picture. ie education, people's incentives and why they misuse the word education 

Systems thinking

one of things we do that a lot of people can't is we understand emergence and properties of systems. A lot of people think very reductionist. you can't understand the interactions between things if you have that mindset. 

CPS 

Smart, intelligent, techy, sophisticated, big picture look at things.
